# Online-Resume-
Project Two Overview:
The focus of our second project was on the incorporation of Bootstrap to craft a responsive online resume. This tool significantly enhanced the aesthetics and functionality of the resume, presenting it as an invaluable asset for future job and internship applications.

Personal Experience & Challenges:

Bootstrap Integration: I found Bootstrap to be user-friendly and efficient. Though initial adoption was daunting due to my unfamiliarity with it, I quickly appreciated its capability to simplify the coding process.

Resource Limitations: While Zybooks provided limited information on Bootstrap's syntax, external platforms like W3Schools and Bootstrap's official documentation proved invaluable. They guided my template selection and the subsequent customizations I made.
Technical Hiccups: Despite incorporating the correct CDN for Bootstrap icons, I encountered issues displaying icons like the email, map, and phone. This is a challenge I plan to address in future iterations of the project.

Layout & Formatting Challenges: Understanding the nuances of Bootstrap, especially with elements like padding and the 'container-fluid' syntax, was initially challenging. Aligning my page as per the desired theme was another area of struggle.

Concluding Thoughts:

Embarking on this project was both enlightening and enjoyable. Grappling with Bootstrap deepened my appreciation for web development tools and expanded my toolkit. Zybooks, W3Schools, and YouTube were instrumental in this learning journey. Eagerly, I anticipate our next project, where we'll delve into the world of JavaScript.
